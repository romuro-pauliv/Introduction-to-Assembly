## Part II - Digital Logic Circuits

Viewing computer systems at the digital logic level exposes us to the nuts and bolts of the basic hardware. The goal of this chapter is to cover the necessary digital logic background. Our discussion can be divided into three parts. 

### I - Basic Digital Logic Circuits
In the first part, we focus on the basics of digital logic circuits. We start off with a look at the basic gates such as `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` gates. We introduce **Boolean algebra** to manipulate logical expressions. We also explain how logical expressions are simplified in order to get an efficient digital circuit implementation.

### II - Combinational Circuits
The second part introduces combinational circuits, which provide a higher level of abstraction than the basic circuits discussed in the first part. We review several commonly used combinational circuits including **multiplexers**, **decoders**, **comparators**, **adders**, and **ALUs**. 

### III - Sequential Circuits
In the last part, we review sequential circuits. In sequential circuits, the output depends both on the current inputs as well as the past history. This feature brings the notion of time into digital logic circuits. We introduce **system clock** to provide this timing information. We discuss two types of circuits: `latches` and `flip-flops`. These devices can be used to store a single bit of data. Thus, they provide the basic capability to design memories. These devices can be used to build larger memories, a topic covered in detail in the next chapter.
