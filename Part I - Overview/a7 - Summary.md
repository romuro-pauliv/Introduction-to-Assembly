## Summary

We introduced assembly language and discussed where it fits in the hierarchy of computer languages. Our discussion focused on the usefulness of high-level languages vis-Ã -vis the assembly language. We noted that high-level languages are preferred, as their use aids in faster program development, program maintenance, and protability. Assembly language, however, provides two chief benefits: faster program execution, and access to system hardware. We give more details on the assembly language in [Parts V]() and [VI]().
