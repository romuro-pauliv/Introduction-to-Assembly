## Part I - Overview

The main objective of this chapter is to give you a brief introduction to the assembly language. To achieve this goal, we compare and contrast the assembly language with high-level languages you are familiar with. This comparison enables us to take a look at the pros and cons of the assembly language vis-a-vis high-level languages.
