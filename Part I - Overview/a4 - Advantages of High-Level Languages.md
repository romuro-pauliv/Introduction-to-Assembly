## Advantages of High-Level Languages
High-level languages are preferred to program applications, as they provide a convenient abstraction of the underlying system suitable for problem solving. Here are some advantages of programming in a high-level language:

---

### Program development is faster
Many high-level languages provide structures (sequential, selection, iterative) that facilitate program development. Programs written in a high-level language are relatively small compared to the equivalent programs written in an assembly language. These programs are also easier to code and debug.

### Programs are easier to maintain
Programming a new application can take from several weeks to several months and the
lifecycle of such an application software can be several years. Therefore, it is critical that software development be done with a view of software maintainability, which involves activities ranging from fixing bugs to generating the next version of the software. Programs written in a high-level language are easier to understand and, when good programming practices are followed, easier to maintain. Assembly language programs tend to be lengthy and take more time to code and debug. As a result, they are also difficult to maintain.

### Programs are portable
High-level language programs contain very few processor-specific details. As a result, they can be used with little or no modification on different computer systems. In contrast, assembly language programs are processor-specific.
