## Typical Applications

We have identified three main advantages to programming in an assembly language.

1. Time-efficiecy
2. Accessibility to hardware
3. Space-efficiency

**Time-efficiency**: Applications for which the execution speed is important fall under two categories:

1. Time convenience (to improve performance)
2. time critial (to satisfy functionality)

Applications in the first category benefit from time-efficient programs because it is convenient or desirable. However, time-efficiency is not absolutely necessary for their operation. For example, a graphics package that scales an object instantaneously is more pleasant to use than the one that takes noticeable time.

In **time-critical applications**, tasks have to be completed within a specified time period. These applications, also called **real-time applications**, include aircraft navigation systems, process control systems, robot control software, communications software, and target acquisition (e.g., missile tracking) software.

**Accessbility to hardware**: System software often direct control over the system hardware. Examples include operating systems, assemblers, compilers, linkers, loaders, device drivers, and network interfaces. Some applications also require hardware control. Video games are an obvious example. 

**Space-efficiency**: AS mentioned before, for most systems, compactness of application code is not a major concern. However, in protable and handheld devices, code compactness is an important factor. Space-efficiency is also important in spacecraft control systems.
